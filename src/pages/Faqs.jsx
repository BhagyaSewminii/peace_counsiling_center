        <h3 className='text-lg text-center leading-loose font-medium mb-2'>How long does counseling typically last?</h3>
        <p className='text-base text-center leading-loose text-gray-700'>The length of counseling varies depending on your individual needs and goals. Some people find short-term therapy (a few weeks or months) helpful, while others benefit from ongoing therapy. You and your counselor will discuss the duration of treatment during your initial sessions.</p>

      <div className='mb-8'>
        <h3 className='text-lg text-center leading-loose font-medium mb-2'>How does counseling work?</h3>
        <p className='text-base text-center leading-loose text-gray-700'>Rarely are our minds calm and settled. We think about millions of things each and every day. We compare our lives to others, we are inundated with information about how we should look, what we should buy, how we should feel. Add in anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem to the mix and it's not difficult to imagine becoming overwhelmed. We have too many negative thoughts in our head, too many negative feelings in our heart to hold it all in. Counseling will provide a safe space for you to express yourself and release those thoughts/feelings. With less noise in your mind and body, you can begin to discover how you want to grow and what steps need to be taken to get there. My first priority is to never let you feel judged for what you say in a counseling session and to never let you feel alone in this journey.</p>
